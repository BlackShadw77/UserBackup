# UserBackup
Backup and restore Windows user files using robocopy and batch scripts

Simply run the "BackupUser.bat" to copy the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and Videos folders to the location the batch file is run from under the username of the account currently logged in.

Restore in the same way by running "RestoreUser.bat" to copy the backed up folders to the %UserProfile% directory.

This is designed to be run from a USB or Network Folder (Cabled connection recommended).
