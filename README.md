# UserBackup
Backup and restore Windows user files using robocopy and batch scripts

Simply run the "BackupUser.bat" to copy users files to the location of the batch file under their username.

Restore in the same way by running "RestoreUser.bat" to copy the backed up folders to the %UserProfile% directory.

Folders backed up by default are the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and Videos folders.

This is designed to be run from a USB or Network Folder (Cabled connection recommended).
